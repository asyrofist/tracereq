# Simple-Traceability-SRS-Documents
this is repository how to make simple traceability from requirement documents, 
you can check this out to [live demo](https://wordembed.herokuapp.com/)

Comparative Studies of Several Methods for Building Simple Traceability and Identifying The Quality Aspects of Requirements in SRS Documents described in [our paper at EECCIS2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9263479). Please kindly cite the following paper when you use this tool. It would also be appreciated if you send me a courtesy [website](http://rakha.asyrofi.com/) and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WN9T5UUAAAAJ&hl=id&oi=ao), so I could survey what kind of tasks the tool is used for.
